# MERN LINKTREE PROJECT
In Linktree/site [Frontend part is in .. or Frontend folder and backend part is in Server folder.

For getting a rough demo of how a website pages looks , I've uploaded pictures of the different pages 
In this project, I've created the registration and login page using the NEXT.JS template for frontend and NODE.JS for developing backend and also integrated both of them using API for communication of frontend with backend and along with this there is dedicated dashboard to show the uploaded number of links and growth for the user. 
Along with that I've developed a links addition page for adding links to it and linked that link-page to direct userprofile where all links will be shown as link tree.
